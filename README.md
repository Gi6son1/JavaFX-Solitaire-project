# JavaFX-Solitaire-project

This was a java project given to us in university!
The aim of the project was to create an adaptation of the soilitare game, Patience.
Developing this game required a firm grasp of the OOP principles, and I added a few extra features for some flair!

While GitHub's automated programming language analyser for the project specifies 'HTML', this is simply because there are javadoc html files in the repo as well as the java class files.
